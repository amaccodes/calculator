# 🧮 Calculator

This is a browser-based **Calculator** app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It was created as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum to solidify my understanding of JavaScript logic, functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
